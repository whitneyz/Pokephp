# Pokephp
Make a Pokédex using this API.

Basic functionality that is expected (read: core features):

You can search a pokémon by name and by ID
Of said pokémon you need to show:
The ID-number
An image (sprite)
At least 4 "moves"
The previous evolution, only if it exists, along with their name and image. Be carefull, you cannot just do ID-1 to get the previous form, for example look into "magmar" - "magmortar". You have to use a seperate api call for this!
Make your web page look like a pokédex by adding a little CSS.

Note: For this exercise, the goal is to keep working on it, until the deadline is reached. If you are finished adding all "core features", look at what else the API has to offer, and try adding some other features. At the end of the deadline, everyone is going to present the pokédex they made; As such it is important that you have published your web page on GitHub!

Extra challenge
There are a couple of pokemon that don't play with the normal rules, add code so their cases are also handled elegantly.

Ditto only has 1 move.
Eevee has 6 evolutions.

Title: The pokemon challenge - PHP style
Repository: challenge-pokemon-php

Type of Challenge: Learning

Duration: 3 days

Deployment strategy : NA

Team challenge : solo

Learning objectives
Starting with PHP
To be able to write a simple condition and a simple loop
To know how to access external resources (API)
To know where to search for PHP documentation
To find out how much easier it is to learn a second programming language
The Mission
Remember the Pokemon challenge we did in Javascript? Today we are going to re-create this challenge in PHP!

You will be surprised how easy it is to pick a new language, once you know your first programming language (Javascript).

Take a deep breath, and remember: you can do this!

Tips
Here are a few functions you will need to help you on your way.

file_get_contents()
json_decode()
var_dump() - to help you debug
Be careful to get an array, not an object, back from json_decode(). Read the documentation how to do this. You could do it with objects, but it will be more difficult.

How to search for PHP documentation
PHP has very good documentation available on www.php.net. There is a nice trick you can use to quickly get documentation on any php function. Just type in the browser php.net/FUNCTION_NAME and you will arrive at the correct documentation page. Also spend some time clicking on the "See Also" section at the bottom of each page, this will quickly get you a good overview of what is possible with PHP.

PHP the right way
Another interesting read is https://phptherightway.com. This is not so much documentation over each separate function, but gives you more an overview of best practices and how different components work together.
